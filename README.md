# PyBer_Analysis
## list of deliverables 
- Import your data into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Merge your DataFrames.
- Create a bubble chart that showcases the average fare versus the total number of rides with bubble size based on the total number of drivers for each city type, including urban, suburban, and rural.
- Determine the mean, median, and mode for the following:
	- The total number of rides for each city type.
	- The average fares for each city type.
	- The total number of drivers for each city type.
- Create box-and-whisker plots that visualize each of the following to determine if there are any outliers:
	- The number of rides for each city type.
	- The fares for each city type.
	- The number of drivers for each city type.
- Create a pie chart that visualizes each of the following data for each city type:
	- The percent of total fares.
	- The percent of total rides.
	- The percent of total drivers.
## Overview
The goal of this analysis was to examine how PyBer operates according to different city types of Urban, Suburban, and Rural. The metrics examined were the total rides of each type, total drivers, average fare per ride, and finally average fare per driver. Ultimately, we wanted to provide a visualization that demonstrated how each type of city *fared* between January 1st, 2019 to April 28th, 2019 looking at weekly data.
